# Writing Lists

Written in order of interest and importance. The order inside each category doesn't really matter. 

* Progressive subcompact publications
	1.  Do all paradigms for copy protection and owner rights apply to an open web publication?
	2. Is it useful to build cross platform versions of our publications? If so what tool should we use?
	3. Is it now possible to create multiple content delivery vehicles from the same source?

<strike>
3.  Long form publishing using concepts of progressive web applications: An exploration of how far we can push the web as a publishing medium.
  *  What can we do beyond offline?
  *  Is it possible to have a fully offline reading experience after first download?
  * How have reader expectations changed?
	* How do existing and upcoming technologies benefit online publishing?
</strike>

* ES6 Classes, how they work and how we extend them
	* Prerequisite for any work in Polymer 2.0

* Front end web
	1. A more conceptual piece to follow up on [What kind of web do we want](https://publishing-project.rivendellweb.net/what-kind-of-web-do-we-want/) and expands on some of the points I tried to make there.
	2. Are we spoiled for choice? There’s so many choices at all levels of the development stack (both back and front end) that it’s scary for someone coming in to the field. I’ll present my own opinionated choices and sample scripts using them.
	 3. Create a set of paged media CSS to match layouts in Kinfolk and Wired
* Accessibility
	1. I got dinged on accessibility big time. More research, experimentation and development, particularly in my Polymer apps
	2. Building accessibility into your development workflow
		* Gulp tools and workflows
* Polymer
	1. Research Polymer 2.0, changes and upgrades for existing components and how to create new ones
		* Get as much information as you can from the Polymer Summit in London
		* Is it worth upgrading or do we need to recreate existing elements
	2. Polymer based theme for WordPress blog
	3. Get back to my book proposal on web components. Run it by reviewers and see if Pragmatic will accept it or not
		* Upgrade information to V1 specs and Polymer 2
	4. A visual editor for long form content based on my Athena set of web components and the Polymer editor
		* Is the editor ready for Polymer 2.0?
		* Is the editor ready for primetime? It doesn’t seem to be a high priority for people working on development
		* Since the client is written using Atom Shell, can we do the same thing for the resulting content?
